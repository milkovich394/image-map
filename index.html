                    one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the fictional continent of Westeros. </p> 
                <p>As Tyrion is born a dwarf and his mother died during childbirth, he is resented by Tywin since birth. </p>
                <p>Tyrion uses his status as a Lannister partly to mitigate the prejudice he has received all of his life, 
                    especially from Tywin and his sister, Cersei Lannister. He soothes his inadequacies with wine, wit and self-indulgence.</p>
                <p>As a civil war begins, he is sent by Tywin to impose order on the capital as well as serve as his nephew 
                    King Joffrey Baratheon's acting Hand of the King in his absence. Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect 
                    the city and family, narrowly winning the Battle of the Blackwater. </p>
                <p>When his father returns and takes his position 
                    as Hand of the King, Tyrion is compensated with the difficult position of Master of Coin. He is framed for Joffrey's murder 
                    and flees Westeros for Essos. </p>
